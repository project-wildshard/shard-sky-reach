# Build the shard on CI

The lift proved build:shards on the Mac, whose ancestor node_modules
can supply undeclared packages. Add the real build command to the clean
runner after check, retaining shard and hook tests. CI now has to cook
the shard using only this repository and its locked dependencies.

This change uploads nothing and alters no settings. Runner failures
will be reproduced and repaired here when this shard owns them; engine
and sharddev defects are listed in the cross-repo report instead.

The first Ubuntu runner CI is green at b699b71c6780 (run 42438700371).
The new build step completed, followed by the existing shard and hook
tests. No runner-only defect or missing package surfaced. Close A2
after the implementation landed on origin/main with normal hooks green.
