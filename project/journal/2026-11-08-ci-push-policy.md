# Finish push verdicts and scope Ring 2

Jake J193/J194: active push CI now finishes; only PR runs cancel.
The main CI summary names its target SHA and paginated included commits
since the previous finished, non-cancelled push. It does not give an
intermediate SHA an independent green verdict. Summary reporting is
informational; every existing check keeps its blocking behavior.

Ring 2 prepare now runs for its own source, test, asset, dependency,
configuration and workflow paths on main, plus nightly at 03:35 UTC.
Manual candidate dispatch and every native preparation check remain.

Actionlint passes. Parsed before/after job inventories retain both
original jobs and every original step. Normal commit and full push
hooks remain enabled. No pins, runtime source, visibility, credentials,
test caps or ratchets changed.
